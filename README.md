# FaceIDTouchIDAuthentication

This demo created using SwiftUI.

Users can setup FaceId/TouchId authentication after doing a credentials login.

We did not need to fill up credentials when you open an app once again. You can authenticate users using FaceId/TouchId authentication.

The app will work on the below flow:
1. Open the app
2. Do it log in with default credentials (Username: Chandresh, Password: 123456)
3. Setup FaceId/TouchId authentication
4. Closed the app and open it once again.
5. Open the app and do it FaceId/TouchId authentication. 
Now you do not need any credentials to login it.
